# Futures Data Sources

Futures history is stored by expiring contract. A continuous series is a research construction,
so record the contract-selection rule, roll trigger, and price adjustment along with the output.

!!! note "Verified September 2026"
    Entries were checked against the linked official product documentation. Coverage and access
    depend on the vendor contract and can change.
