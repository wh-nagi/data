## Quick Start

```python
import os
os.environ["FINNHUB_API_KEY"] = "your_key_here"

from ml4t.data.providers import FinnhubProvider

with FinnhubProvider() as provider:
    quote = provider.fetch_quote("AAPL")
```

`fetch_quote()` uses Finnhub's free US quote endpoint. Historical candles use a premium endpoint:

```python
with FinnhubProvider() as provider:
    history = provider.fetch_ohlcv(
        "AAPL",
        "2024-01-01",
        "2024-12-01",
        frequency="daily",
    )
```

Do not assume that a free key can call `fetch_ohlcv()`. Finnhub's current pricing table lists US
OHLC history under its paid plan.
