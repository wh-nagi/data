## Overview

CoinGecko provides comprehensive cryptocurrency market data with broad coverage and no authentication required.

**Best For**: Crypto market overview, simple API

---

## Quick Start

```python
from datetime import UTC, datetime, timedelta

from ml4t.data.providers import CoinGeckoProvider

provider = CoinGeckoProvider()
end = datetime.now(UTC).date() - timedelta(days=1)
start = end - timedelta(days=6)

# Use CoinGecko IDs (not ticker symbols)
df = provider.fetch_ohlcv("bitcoin", str(start), str(end), frequency="daily")
df = provider.fetch_ohlcv("ethereum", str(start), str(end), frequency="daily")

provider.close()
```

---

## Symbol Format

CoinGecko uses coin IDs, not ticker symbols:

| Coin | CoinGecko ID |
|------|--------------|
| Bitcoin | `bitcoin` |
| Ethereum | `ethereum` |
| Solana | `solana` |
| Cardano | `cardano` |

Find IDs at [coingecko.com/api/documentation](https://www.coingecko.com/api/documentation).

## Supported Frequencies

| Frequency | Available |
|-----------|-----------|
| `daily` | ✅ |
| Intraday | ❌ |

The OHLC endpoint can supply 29 complete UTC daily bars. Its 30-day response starts and
ends partway through a UTC day, so the partial boundary days are excluded. Older requests
fail with `DataValidationError` because CoinGecko returns four-day candles, which cannot
be converted into correct daily OHLC values.
