"""AQR factor data provider - comprehensive factor data from AQR Research.

This module provides access to 16 AQR datasets covering academically-rigorous
factor research. AQR Capital Management is a pioneer in systematic, factor-based
investing and provides these datasets freely to support academic research.

## Dataset Categories

### Core Equity Factors (QMJ, BAB, HML Devil)
Factor returns for quality, low-volatility, and value anomalies across
US and 23 international equity markets. Both monthly and daily frequencies.

### Equity Portfolios
Sorted portfolios for building factor strategies: 6 portfolios (2×3 size × quality)
and 10 decile portfolios sorted on quality.

### Cross-Asset Factors (VME, TSMOM, Momentum Indices)
Value and momentum across 8 asset classes, trend-following across 58 futures,
and equity momentum indices.

### Long-History Datasets
100+ years of factor data for out-of-sample validation and regime analysis.

## Academic Foundation

Each dataset is based on peer-reviewed academic research:

- **QMJ**: Asness, Frazzini & Pedersen (2014) - "Quality Minus Junk"
- **BAB**: Frazzini & Pedersen (2014) - "Betting Against Beta"
- **HML Devil**: Asness & Frazzini (2013) - "The Devil in HML's Details"
- **VME**: Asness, Moskowitz & Pedersen (2013) - "Value and Momentum Everywhere"
- **TSMOM**: Moskowitz, Ooi & Pedersen (2012) - "Time Series Momentum"

    Provider for AQR Capital Management factor data.

    AQR Capital Management is a global investment management firm built around
    the core principle that a systematic, disciplined approach to managing money
    adds value. Founded in 1998, AQR pioneered many factor investing strategies
    and publishes research data for academic use.

    ## Why AQR Factor Data?

    - **Academic Rigor**: Each dataset is based on peer-reviewed research
    - **Global Coverage**: US + 23 international equity markets
    - **Long History**: Some datasets start from 1877 (commodities) or 1920 (century premia)
    - **Cross-Asset**: Factors across equities, bonds, currencies, commodities
    - **Active Updates**: Monthly updates (except static/historical datasets)
    - **Free Access**: No API key required, just download and use

    ## Dataset Categories

    **Core Equity Factors** (16 datasets, actively updated):

    - **QMJ (Quality Minus Junk)**: Long quality stocks (profitable, growing, safe),
      short junk stocks. Quality earns positive risk-adjusted returns.

    - **BAB (Betting Against Beta)**: Exploits the low-volatility anomaly. Many
      investors can't leverage, so they overweight risky stocks. BAB goes long
      leveraged low-beta and short high-beta stocks.

    - **HML Devil**: Improved value factor using more timely price data. Earns
      305-378 bps/year alpha over standard HML.

    **Equity Portfolios**:
    - QMJ 6 Portfolios: Size × Quality sorted portfolios (2×3 sort)
    - QMJ 10 Portfolios: Quality decile portfolios for monotonicity tests

    **Cross-Asset Factors**:

    - **VME (Value & Momentum Everywhere)**: Factors across 8 asset classes.
      Value and momentum are negatively correlated, providing diversification.

    - **TSMOM (Time Series Momentum)**: Trend-following across 58 futures.
      12-month lookback, 1-month hold. Foundation for CTA strategies.

    - **Momentum Indices**: Index-level momentum (US Large Cap, Small Cap, Intl)

    **Long-History Datasets**:

    - **Century of Factor Premia**: 100+ years of value, momentum, carry, defensive
      factors. Essential for out-of-sample validation.

    - **Commodities for the Long Run**: 140+ years of commodity data.
      Shows carry (term structure) is key driver of returns.

    ## Usage

    ```python
    from ml4t.data.providers import AQRFactorProvider

    # First time: download data from AQR website
    AQRFactorProvider.download()

    # Initialize provider (uses downloaded parquet files)
    provider = AQRFactorProvider()

    # List available datasets
    provider.list_datasets()
    provider.list_datasets(category="equity_factors")
    provider.list_categories()

    # Fetch factor data
    qmj = provider.fetch("qmj_factors", region="USA")
    bab = provider.fetch("bab_factors", region="Global")
    tsmom = provider.fetch("tsmom")
    century = provider.fetch("century_premia")

    # Get educational information about a dataset
    info = provider.get_dataset_info("qmj_factors")
    print(info["description"])  # Rich educational description
    print(info["paper"])        # Academic reference
    print(info["use_cases"])    # Practical applications
    ```
